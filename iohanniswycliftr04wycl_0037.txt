5. The Edition.

Of the three manuscripts in which Wyclif’s book on the Church
has been preserved, A has formed the basis of the following text:
the Codex A being not only, comparatively speaking, correct, but one
which moreover was copied in England.

On account of the great length of the chapters, the copyist of
A has divided them into numerous paragraphs (A, B, C, D ἃς),
and even these paragraphs are again subdivided (a, b, c ἃς, 1, 2, 3 δὶα).
This arrangement has been retained in the present edition, partly for
the sake of practical convenience, inasmnch as the careful breaking
up of the chapters into paragraphs assists the eye, especially for
reference or quotation; partly also that the peculiarities of the original,
which in all probability possessed this arrangement, might stand out
the more clearly. It is not however to be denied that the multitude of
letters and figures on the left hand margins is at first sight somewhat
confusing.

The Latin marginal glosses of A are given in the text amongst
the variants,

All the variants of Β have been noted, for B, as we have said,
is fairly correct, and not [infrequently gives the better reading. Where
this is the case, the reading of B is adopted in the text, and the cor-
responding readings of A and A1 are relegated to the notes.

Account is given in the notes of a few emendations of the text.
Emendations have never been made without the most absolute necessity,
and never when there seemed any doubt as to how the text should
be restored.

Only a small selection from the readings of Al has been given
in the notes: Al being, as we have seen, nothing but a copy of A.
On the other hand a complete record has been made of the variants
of D.

The spelling is that of the manuscripts: all the peculiarities that
the Latin spelling of the πέτῃ] and [5ὼ centuries exhibits are conspicuous
in this edition. Where the spelling of the manuscripts is variable, as
in secuntur, sequntur, sequuntur, loquntur, loquuntur, docum, dogma,
mihi, michi dhe. the more usual orthography has been followed
in the text. In the case of quotations from the Bible, where
