4. The Imitations of Wyolifs tract on the Church.

a. The treatise of ‹Iohn Hus “Coneerning the Church”.

Wyclif’s book on the Church received more honour abroad than
at home. ssy the year 1407 at latest, its contents were known in
Bohemia‚ and on Bohemian soil the English master found an apostle‚
Magister John of Hnssinec, called Hus, who embraced his teaching
with enthusiasm, and proved ready cheerfully to die for it. From the
very beginning of the movement of reform, Hus warmly hailed the
appearance of NVyclif’s writings, and so far as they came within his
reach, he imbibed and reproduced their teaching‚ which became part
and parcel of his own mind. But of all Wyclifs works, none fascin-
ated him to such a degree as the book on the Church. As early as
1412, the year of the famous controversy on indulgenceS‚ he comes
forward with arguments which are simply and entirely W'yclif's:
and his well-known pamphlet on papal absolution is for the most
part taken word for word from the 23‘0' chapter of Wyclif’s “De
ecclesia''.¹ From the opening definition of absolution, to the close
of the deductions which follow, all is the intellectual property of
Wyclif. Hus also borrowed the arguments in support of five propo-
sitions of Wyclif's, which he gave to the world soon afterwards,
srom the treatise on the Church.2 In the spring of 1413 King W‘enzel
of Bohemia made an attempt to restore the broken peace of the
Church in his dominions, and to this end to reconcile the Magister
John Hus with his opponents. The attempt was however a fanum,
The two parties could come to no understanding over the concep-
tion of the Church. The opponents understood by the Church that
of which the Pope was the head, and the college of Cardinals the
body3 - Hus, on the other hand, had completely adopted the
XVycliffian doctrine of the Church, explained above. Against these
opponents he wrote, in imitation of Wyclif, his book “On the Cht1rch''‚
a work which created in its day a most powerful sensation, whilst
Wyclif’s work of the same name, from which it is taken word for
