xviii INTRODUCTION.

used to entertain the auditory of his sermons.¹ The enthusiastic
admiration of Nicolaus Faulfisch for Wyclif appears in his having
brought to Prague not only a certificate (stated to have been forged
by Faulfisch himself) giving the attestation of the University of Oxford
to Wyclif’s orthodoxy—-but also a piece of Wyclif’s gravestone‚ which
was venerated by the Bohemian Wycliffites as a precious relic.2

It is very curious‚ that Hus, when questioned at the Council, could
not remember who the companion of Faulfisch had been. On being
asked who had brought this “forged'’ document to Prague, he answered‚
“Nicolaus Faulfisch, with another, whose name I do not know''. And
yet George of Knyehnicz was studying at Prague, and took academical
degrees there, at the time that Hus was Rector of the University.3

The three tracts contained in Cod. A. were not originally bound
together into one volume. This may be seen, not so much from the
separate paging of each tract, as from the circumstance that they have
not been bound in the same order in which they were written. The
first in date was the “De veritate sa‘crae scripturae”: then came the “De
dominio divino”‚ and lastly “De ecclesia'': in the present volume how-
ever “De ecclesia’' is placed in the middle.

It is evident also that the three tracts were not bound together
before they reached ssohemia; for a parchment document, relating to
the founding of a Church in the Moravian town of Meseritz,⁴ forms

respondit: “Equidem scio te Christo non esse maiorem speroque me non esse
peiorem diabolo, Iam vem, quia clementissimus dominus Christus placide literas
sacras a diabolo audivit, quidni igitur tu audias qui minor sis Christo a me homine?”
