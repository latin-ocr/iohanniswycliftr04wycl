X INTRODUCTION.

uttering violent threats against the realm and government, they
retreated to westminster Abbey, in the belief that they were secured
by the privileges of that Church from any further proceedings of the
government against them. But a troop of armed soldiers rushed into
the Abbey3—one of the knights was taken prisoner,—the other, who
defended himself vigorously, and accused the King's advisers of in-
justice, of greed, and of giving evil counsel, was stabbed. This occurrence
naturally excited great commotion in the monastic precincts: the
Archbishop and four of his Suffragans pronounced sentence of excom-
munication upon the instigators and perpetrators of the deed, but
expressly excepted the King, his mother, and the Duke of Lancaster.
The Bishop of London published the ban three times a week at
St. Paul’s. When summoned to Windsor by the King’s Council, he refused
to appear. Then it was that, on October the 18⁸³, Parlianient met at
Gloucester, and that Wyclif laid before it the memorial of which we have
spoken. He defends very powerfully the action ofthe government, though
without attempting to excuse the deed of violence which took place in the
Church. He maintains however, that but for an accidental combination
of circumstances, the affair would never have terminated as it did.
As then the Abbey of 'Westminster had appealed to its privileges,
Wyclif subjects those privileges to a careful examination (Cap. Χ). But
in the first place he discusses the nature of privileges in general (Cap.
vm, IX). There are no true privileges except those which are founded
in Holy Scripture. Those privileges with which Christ has endowed His
Church consist of spiritual blessings.¹ Other privileges, such as immunities,
prerogatives, outward honours, property and worldly dOminion, ruin
the Church32 — they are snares of Satan. People who seek after
privileges of this kind, do not belong to the Church.3 The highest and
the most ancient privileges of the Church are contingent upon poverty‚

collatis. 2 Non licet clero insistere circa privilegia terrena cuiusmodi videntur
esse, excempciones prerogative‚ proprietates et seculares dominaciones‚ cum vitientur
repugnare privilegiis Christi, que non licet amittere... Quantum ad alia insignia

non privilegia sed diabolica sagena . Inter omnes cautelas diaboii mundana
