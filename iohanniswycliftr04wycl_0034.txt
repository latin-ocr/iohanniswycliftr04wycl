xxviii INTRODUCTloN.

bear the same title “De ecclesia‘’; but their connexion with Wyclif's
book is only an indirect one, their immediate reference being to the
work of Hus. The most considerable of Hus's opponents was un-
doubtedly Stanislaus of Znaim. After his banishment from Prague in
the year 1413, he retired into‘Moravia, where, until his death in
1414, he employed his fertile pen against the Bohemian and Mora-
vian followers of Wyclif. At this time the two tracts were composed,
which he, after the example of Wyclif and Hus, entitled “De eccle-
sia’' ¹3 —- writings which will however bear no comparison‚ as to matter
and form, with Wyclif's work, or even with that of Hus. The one
tract contains a collection of definitions of the Church: the other,
which is rather more detailed‚ treats of the papal power of the keyS.
Both these works seem moreover to have been only preparatory to
a larges treatise “De ecclesia’'‚ which he did not live to write. He
died suddenly just as he was about to set off on his journey to
Constance, to attend the Council.

It is impossible to speak of Stanislaus of Znahn, without at the
same time calling to mind Stephan of Palecz, since the two were
united, as at first in their affection for Hus, so latterly in their hatred
towards him. Like StanislaUS, Stephan (who was one of the principal
accusers of Hus at C01ista11ce)‚de110unced Wyclif both in speech and
writing: Wyclif's conception of the Church was an especial object os
attack, and it is against this doctrine that the so-called “Replicatio
Quidamistarun1’'2 and the two tracts “De ecclesia'’ are directed.

c. John Hofmann of Schweidnitz.

Amongst the earliest opponents of VVyclifism in Bobemia was John
Hofmann of Schweidnitz (in Silesia), who for many years held an
influential position amongst the German Professors at the University
of Prague. XVhen, in consequence of the revolution which took place
in that University‚ in the year 1409, the Professors left Prague, and ¹
formed a new sphere of labour at Leipzig, Hofmann was of their

In the Cod. Treboniensi (Wittingau) A 16, the title runs: “stanislaus de Znoyma

contra Ηυς, De ecclesia’'. ² As Hus bestowed upon Palecz the name ol' “liar''

(fictor), so the latter called the adhereuts of Hus “Quidamistae''.
