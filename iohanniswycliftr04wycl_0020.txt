xiv INTRODUCTION.

Emperor should receive his crown from the hands of the Pope,¹ or
for the papal claim to universal dominion. The secular power of the
Pope is not derived from Christ, but from the Emperor.

Nowhere does Wyclif uphold so strongly the civil authority of
the King over the clergy, as in the book on the Church. This authority
is a natural outcome of monarchy itself; for the King would not be
lord of all England‚ if more than a fourth part of the country were
to be withdrawn from his jurisdiction‚ as belonging to the dead hand.‘-'
Privileges and temporalities are bestowed upon the clergy only condi-
tionally: should they fail to fulfil the conditions, the clergy fall
under the penalty of confiscation of the estates of the dead hand.
English history tells of many such confiscationsz—Wyclif refers both
to ancient and to more recent precedents‚ as for example, under
William the Conqueror, Edward III. and even quite lately under
Richard ΙΙ.3 Finally‚ he denies with great emphasis, that the discussion
of these subjects is likely to incite the laity to plunder the property
of the Church, or that the country was in a better state when these
questions were allowed to slumber.

e. The concluding chapters of the book on the Church.

Chapters vul—XVI form a sequel to chapter vn. We can hardly
be wrong in conjecturing that some at any rate of the arguments brought
forward in these Chapters, were used in the parliamentary discussion:
— a great part however of chapters VIII—XVI consists in refutationis
of his opponents‚ one of whom ventured the strange assertion, that
no confiscation of Church property had ever taken place in England.

After thus discussing the secular relations of the Church, Wyclif
returns to the subject of the Church itself. The connexion between the
chapters is here no longer so close as formerly; there is no lack of
repetition3 some passages, for instance the entire twentieth chapter,

¹ Nec video quomodo fundabitur pure ex fide scripture quod oportet impera-
torem accipere imperium a suo pontifice . . . Non video quin oporteret concedere
quod papa et totum genus sacerdotum dominaretur seculariter super singulos reges
terre. ² Si omnia illa bona quibus dotatur nostra ecclesia immediate pertinerent
ad papam, sic quod rex non haberet interesse in possessionibus vel personis, cum
plus quam quarta pars in manu mortua est decisa. -— ² omnin ista suppono ex
chronicis et tamquam proxima per se notis.
