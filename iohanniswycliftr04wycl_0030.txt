422 End “Deo Gracias'’.

In the Imperial Library of Vienna there are two more Codices,
3930 and 4527, which have been supposed to contain the treatise “De
ecclesia''.¹ ssut as Shirley has already shown 2, there has been a con-
fusion here with Wyclif's “De fide catholica''. The identity of the
incipit makes it probable, that this is the first book of ‘De Ecclesia
et Membris', a work quite distinct from the seventh book of the Summa
Theologiae''. It must however be remembered that, although the treatise
“De Fide Catholica'' is a distinct work of Wyclif’s, it does commin, if in
very abridged form⁷ much that had been already given in “De ecclesia?

A further explanation of the confusion between the two works
is to be found in the fact that, in the table of contents of the two

manuscripts 3930 and 4527, the treatise “De fide catholica⁷' is cata-
logued under the title “De ecclesia''.

3. Date of Composition.

Shirley has rightly fixed the time of composition at 1378 or 1379.³
With regard to certain parts of the tract, a still closer limit may be
set. Although the entire work owes its existence to Wyclif's contest
with Gregory XI — the “horrible fiend'’‚4 who never could have been

head of the Church - and although some passages so breathe the
spirit of that conflict that it can hardly be imagined but that they
were penned during Gregory's life-time, — nevertheless by far the

greater part of the tract was written after the death of that Pontitl‘,
which took place on the 27⁸¹ of March, 137S.⁵ If we bear in mind
