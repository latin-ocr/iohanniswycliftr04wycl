INTRonucrioN. xiii

privileges could only be justly taken away if they were abused‚ and
it was not the intention of the Duke of Lancaster to diminish the
prerogatives of the Abbey. But here was a case of open treason‚
than which a worse crime does not existt¹ and to make of the Abhey
a den, in which every criminal may find protection from the law, is
not the way to honour the Church, or to benefit the monks. The
Abbot and Convent would have done wisely had they remained
passive on this occasion.2

Wyclif then enlarges upon the bad effects of the rich endowments
of the Church. These endowments are contrary to the doctrine and
the example of Christ and of the early Church (Cap. XIII).

There is no warrant in Holy Scripture for the secular wealth
of the Church. Itis the cause of many dangers: the only expla-
nation of the present schism is to be found in the insatiable desire
of the clergy for worldly goods.3 If the clergy would but live in
evangelical poverty, as in the time of Christ, all disputes amongst
the nations of Christendom would come to an end. Therefore those
persons are in error, who believe that the more they spend upon
the Church, the greater their merit: a cup of cold water offered
sincerely and with good will, is perhaps a gift of higher value than
lands and kingdoms.⁴

And as of the worldly possessions of the Church in general, so
of endowments and the secular authority of the Roman Church—there
is no foundation for them in Scripture (Cap.X1v): on the other
hand it is clear from numerous passages that Christ and the Apostles
preferred a life of poverty to earthly power. Our clergy parade on
horseback, with armed retainers, as if they were kings. There is no
foundation in Scripture either for regarding it as indispensable that the
