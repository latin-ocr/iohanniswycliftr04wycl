word7 passed comparatively unnoticed. The arrangement of the work
(like Wyclif‚ Hus breaks up his treatise into twenty-three chapters)
the fundamental ideas, and the process of reasoning‚ all are sim-
ply borrowed from Wyclif.¹ Only those portions of Wyclif's work
which relate to ecclesiastical and political disputes in England; i.e.
the greater part of Chapters V11— XVII, — are set aside‚ to be used,
together with the last chapter, on another occasion. The treatise of
Hus falls naturally into two parts: the first of which treats of the
theory of the Church, of the Cburch's unity, of its head and its
members, of the Pope and of the power of the keys; the second part
confutes the opinions of Hus's opponents. The main weight will
thus be seen to lie in the first part, in which the abstract conceptions
are defined3 and here there is hardly a sentence of any importance
that is not to be found word for word in Wyclif. The sequence of
thought is however much clearer and more methodical in Wyclif’s
work; Hus often reproduces Wyclif only in the briefest epitome. In
short, the work of Hus can only be described as a very faint reflec-
tion of Wyclif’s3 sundry antagonistic remarks upon his Bohemian
opponents alone laying any claim to originality.

It would appear from the fact that Hus has followed the ar-
guments and conclusions of Wyclif with such verbal exactneSS, that
the study of the Manuscripts of Hus's work would be of very great
consequence for the textual criticism of Wyclif's “De ecclesia'⁷. But
from a number of text-passages it becomes evident‚ that Hus had
before him an inferior MS„ corresponding in fact with Al. For a

critical study of the text of Wyclif's “De ecclesia'’, therefore, the
treatise of Hus is almost valueless.

By means of the work of Hus, Wyclif's tenets as laid down in
his “De ecclesia'' were spread widely throughout Bohemia, where
they called forth both cordial assent and vehement opposition. Friends
